# UI-Ventures_Online-Shopping
UI Ventures is a profit-oriented organization that comprises several business divisions. The aim of this project is to implement an online shopping system to replace or augment the current traditional walk-in store model that it operates on.
This repo contains the backend logic, mostly the API, that will power this platform.
